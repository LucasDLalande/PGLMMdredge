#' Phylogenetic tree (ultrametric): tree_ultra
#'
#' An ultrametric phylogenetic tree representing evolutionary distances among
#' 33 species. Species names have been anonymised using capital letters (A, B,
#' C, etc.) for illustrative purpose. This tree can be used for examples
#' involving phylogenetic models, such as `pglmm`. The phylogenetic

#' @format An object of class \code{phylo}, with 33 tips and branch lengths in
#' millions of years.
#' @details The tree was originally generated from  the TimeTree database and
#' then made ultrametric using the \code{force.ultrametric()} function from the
#' \code{phytools} package. Species names were replaced by generic labels to
#' match those in the \code{senescence} dataset.
