Description: The goal of 'selectools' is to provide and facilitate model selection procedures, 
    mostly based on AIC and AICc, and adapting the 'dredge' function from the 'MuMIn' 
    package. 'selectools' contains a unique (for now) function ('pglmm_dredge') that can 
    be used to perform model selection of phylogenetic generalized linear mixed 
    models ('pglmm' from the 'phyr' package). It generates a model selection table 
    of models as would do the 'dredge' function from 'MuMIn' with combinations 
    (subsets) of fixed effect terms in the global model, with optional model 
    inclusion rules.
    Future development include functions designed for the model selection when 
    testing different trajectories as can be done in senescence research, by 
    automatically computing, testing, comparing and ranking constant, linear, 
    quadratic or threshold trajectories.
