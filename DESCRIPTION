Description: This is an adaptation of the dredge function from 'MuMIn' to 
    phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (pglmm from 'phyr'). It 
    generates a model selection table of models based on the dredge 
    function from 'MuMIn' with combinations (subsets) of fixed effect terms in 
    the global model, with optional model inclusion rules.
