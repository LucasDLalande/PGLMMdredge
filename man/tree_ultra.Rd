\description{
An ultrametric phylogenetic tree representing evolutionary distances among
33 species. Species names have been anonymised using capital letters (A, B,
C, etc.) for illustrative purpose. This tree can be used for examples
involving phylogenetic models, such as `pglmm`. The phylogenetic
tree
}
\details{
The tree was originally generated from  the TimeTree database and
then made ultrametric using the \code{force.ultrametric()} function from the
\code{phytools} package. Species names were replaced by generic labels to
match those in the \code{senescence} dataset.
